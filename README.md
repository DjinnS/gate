# Gate : An SSH Proxy that record your sessions

[WIP]

Gate:
  - is "transparent" since you can use it simply with ProxJump or ProxyCommand in your SSH configuration
  - is compatible with all tools that use native SSH workflow
  - is designed to be your best friend for compliance purpose (ISO/PCIDSS)
  - records your session (txt/ttyrec) that way you can review it later (or ask "yes" to your auditor !)

For the moment, Gate only support authentification with signed SSH certificate (more to come).
